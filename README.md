# Social Media Analytics & SocialSense

## Overview üåê

This repository includes two related projects aimed at understanding and analyzing social media influence and sentiment:

1. **Social Media Analytics**: Analyzes key predictors of social influence using a dataset from Kaggle.
2. **SocialSense**: A real-time social media sentiment analyzer application utilizing advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

## Social Media Analytics üìä

### Dataset

The analysis is based on the "Influencers in Social Networks" dataset available on Kaggle:

### Analysis Steps

1. **Data Wrangling**: Processed approximately 5,000 records to handle missing values and clean the data.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Explored the relationships between variables to identify key predictors.
3. **Modeling**: Applied four machine learning models:
   - **Logistic Regression**
   - **Random Forest**
   - **K-Nearest Neighbours**
   - **XGBoost**
   
   The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy of 81%, with the best precision, recall, and F-measure scores of 79%.

### Key Predictors

The top 5 predictors of social influence according to the XGBoost model are:
- `A/B_listed_count`
- `A/B_follower_count`
- `A/B_network_feature_3`
- `A/B_retweets_received`
- `A/B_network_feature_2`

## SocialSense: Social Media Sentiment Analyzer üìà

### Tools & Technologies

- **React JS**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **TensorFlow**: For creating and training deep learning models.
- **PyTorch**: Used for implementing and optimizing machine learning models.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Enhances the model‚Äôs ability to understand context, sarcasm, and nuanced emotions in social media comments.

### Features

- **Real-time Sentiment Analysis**: Integrates machine learning models to analyze sentiment from social media comments as they are posted.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Uses NLP techniques to interpret context, sarcasm, and complex emotional expressions.
